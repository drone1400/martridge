These are all the graphics from Dink Smallwood in uncompressed/packed
.bmp form.

Here is what you can do with them:

*  Modify them and use them in your own Dink Modules (even pay dmods)
*  Use them in your own FREEWARE game you wrote

As long you give us credit - something like:

"Some of the lovely artwork was donated by those wonderful guys from
www.rtsoft.com" would be fine.

If you want to charge for your DMOD, fine, I don't mind.

If you want to write your own RPG engine and use my graphics and give the
game away for free, fine, I don't have a problem.

If you want to write your own RPG engine (or use another other than the Dink
engine) and use my graphics and CHARGE for it, (shareware included) then you
have to talk to me about licensing those particular .bmp's first.

(we also might license the 3dmax models themselves)

Credit for this great artwork goes to Justin Martin who created **ALL OF
THESE** especially for Dink.
